Two approaches for problem 1:
    1. array of rows, fill in first with how many black rows, next with how many
    white rows, etc. Last black row is not included.
    
    2. array of rows, fill in each row with pixels that contain a "border", or
    any white pixels that are in contact with a black pixel.
    
    3. array of coordinates for each "first" white row. If a white pixel is in
    contact with a black pixel it is included.

    4. int starting index, linked list w/ how border follows 
        if flat side of node is next to a black node, guide 

Radius of parasite has to be at least 28,210 pixels
Circumference has to be at least 177,250 pixels, more b/c made of squares, greater b/c not perfectly 


Space approximations:
    1. 1 main pointer, leading to 100,000 pointers, leading to approximately
    100,000 integers (half rows are filled up, those each have 2 ints each in
    them)
    
    2. 1 main pointer, leading to 100,000 pointers, leading to approximately
    250,000 integers 

    3. 250,000 pairs of integers = 500,000 integers

Object where you have starting coordinates, then array of unsigned chars

Problem 4: create map w/ row nums & coords
